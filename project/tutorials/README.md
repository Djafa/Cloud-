# :books: LINGI2145 Project: bootstrap tutorial

:warning: **If you have not read the** [general description](../README.md) **of the project, do it before going through this tutorial.**

This tutorial will guide you through the technologies and necessary tools to run the front-end.
The provided version uses a non persistent storage to save users' data (such as credentials or cart content) in the form of JSON objects.

## Technologies involved in this project

This section gives you a list of pointers to other tutorials you can follow to be familiar with the technology used in the project.

- Learn all you want about Javascript, the programming language of the web, with: [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/);
    - You can also follow this [interactive tutorial](https://javascript.info/).
- Start using Node.js with [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/);
- Official documentation of the [NPM package manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/)
    - We encourage you to go through (at least) the following sections:
        1. [What is npm?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm);
        1. [How to Install Local Packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally);
        1. [Working with package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json).

<!-- - The front-end is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) a Javascript framework for building dynamic web interfaces.
  - :pencil: **Note.** Start reading its [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), and try its [interactive tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). -->

**Do not panic**, all these documentation may seem a lot of content but it is an investment that will reward you later.
<!-- For example, you will continue to write code in Javascript for the back-end development. -->

:checkered_flag: **That's it.** Now you are ready to deploy the front-end, find further instructions in [front-end tutorial](01_ProjectSetup_FrontEnd.md) to start working with the Shopping Cart Application (SCApp).
